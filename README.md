## What is this
Give `bookwyrm` some data which relates to a book, paper or similar.
With this data, it'll look trough all manners of sources (see [here](#planned-supported-sources)),
find some URIs, and then use an external downloader of your choice for processing.
By default, `bookwyrm` might use `aria2c`,
or perhaps something that all systems have at boot.
Not sure yet.
